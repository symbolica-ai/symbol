[![CI](https://github.com/symbolica-ai/symbol/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/symbolica-ai/symbol/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Tiny static-site and media hosting for a tailnet.

The public user guide is [`static/docs.md`](static/docs.md) and is served at
`/`. The implementation-grade HTTP contract is [`API.md`](API.md). This
README is for building and operating the service.

## Build

The crate requires Rust 1.98 or newer.

```sh
python3 tooling/fetch_vendor.py
cargo build --release --locked
```

The first line fetches the KaTeX and highlight.js files that rendered Markdown
pages use into `static/vendor/`. They are not committed: `static/vendor.toml`
pins each npm tarball by its published sha512, and the script checks every
download against it. The build stops with instructions if they are missing or
stale.

With Nix, which fetches and verifies them itself:

```sh
nix build
nix develop
```

`nix develop` also puts them in `static/vendor/` for plain `cargo` use.

The documentation, client, installer, CSS, and those files are compiled into
the binary.

## Run

```sh
SYMBOL_PUBLIC_URL=https://symbol.example \
  cargo run --release --locked -- \
  --bind 127.0.0.1:4340 --root ./data
```

`SYMBOL_PUBLIC_URL` is required in normal server mode and must be one HTTP(S)
origin with no trailing slash or path. Development may instead set
`SYMBOL_ALLOW_DEV_ORIGIN=true`, which uses `http://symbol`.

CLI flags have equivalent environment variables:

- `SYMBOL_BIND` (default `127.0.0.1:4340`)
- `SYMBOL_ROOT` (default `/var/lib/symbol`)
- `SYMBOL_MAX_FILE_SIZE` in bytes (default 4 GiB)
- `SYMBOL_MAX_ARCHIVE_UPLOAD` in bytes (default 50 MiB)
- `SYMBOL_MAX_ARCHIVE_EXTRACTED` in bytes (default 80 MiB)
- `SYMBOL_MAX_ARCHIVE_FILES` (default 5000)
- `SYMBOL_PUBLIC_URL`
- `SYMBOL_ALLOW_DEV_ORIGIN` (default false)
- `SYMBOL_EXPIRY_MIN_AGE` (default `30d`)
- `SYMBOL_EXPIRY_MAX_AGE` (default `365d`)
- `SYMBOL_EXPIRY_MAX_SIZE` (default `512MiB`)
- `SYMBOL_EXPIRY_POWER` (default `3`)
- `SYMBOL_TRUSTED_PROXY_PRINCIPAL_HEADER` and comma-separated
  `SYMBOL_TRUSTED_PROXY`; these must be configured together
- `SYMBOL_AUDIT_TRUSTED_PROXY` separately allows those proxy peers to supply
  the left-most `X-Forwarded-For` address as non-authoritative audit context
- `SYMBOL_MTLS_PRINCIPAL_HEADER` or `SYMBOL_TAILSCALE_USER_HEADER` may replace
  the generic principal header; configure only one identity header
- `SYMBOL_TAILSCALE_WHOIS_COMMAND` selects direct Tailscale user resolution
  through a configured `tailscale` executable and is mutually exclusive with
  identity headers

Archive upload, extracted-size, and file-count limits are independently
configurable with the defaults above.

## Storage and migrations

SQLite stores sites, paths, hashes, sizes, and other metadata in
`SYMBOL_ROOT/symbol.db`. Immutable, Blake3-addressed payloads are stored under
`SYMBOL_ROOT/blobs/`; transient uploads use `SYMBOL_ROOT/tmp/`.

Startup enables WAL, normal synchronous mode, foreign keys, and a five-second
SQLite busy timeout. The canonical schema and versioned migrations are typed
Rust/SeaQuery definitions under `crates/symbol/src/database/`; `schema.sql` is
their generated inspection snapshot and is never executed as migration input.
Migrations run automatically through schema version 6, followed by an
integrity check. Startup also:

- migrates legacy inline SQLite BLOBs to external blob files and verifies
  their size and Blake3 hash;
- imports the legacy catalog when present;
- removes known OS metadata, rebuilds generated `symbol.toml` manifests,
  sweeps expired targets, prunes undo/idempotency records, and removes
  unreferenced blob files.

Migration deliberately fails on unsupported schema versions, failed integrity,
or pre-existing paths that now collide with reserved control names. Back up
before upgrading; there is no downgrade migration.

## Backup

Back up the complete `SYMBOL_ROOT`, not only `symbol.db`. For a directly
copyable, consistent snapshot, stop the service and copy the entire directory.

## Operations

Example systemd and Caddy units are in [`ops/`](ops/). The checked-in service
binds only to loopback and Caddy reverse-proxies the public origins. Build the
release binary before starting it, then adapt user, group, paths, hostnames,
and public URL to the deployment:

```sh
sudo cp ops/symbol.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now symbol
sudo systemctl status symbol
```

The service handles SIGINT/SIGTERM gracefully and logs through `tracing`;
`RUST_LOG` controls filtering.

Managed-site recovery is available to an operator without an HTTP admin route:

```sh
symbol --root /var/lib/symbol admin claim SITE
symbol --root /var/lib/symbol admin rotate SITE --token sym_mgmt_...
```

Both commands print a replacement token once. Protect terminal history and
captured output. If trusted-proxy identity is enabled, only configured peer IPs
may supply the configured principal header; all caller-supplied internal
identity headers are removed. The sample Caddyfile does not enable or inject
identity, so management relies on claim/management tokens by default.

## Development

```sh
./check
```

This runs formatting checks, strict Clippy lints, Rust tests, shell syntax
checks, and client conformance tests. The guide and the API manuals are
rendered at build time, so their renderers are covered by the
`crates/symbol/generation` tests rather than at runtime.

## Versioning

`api-version.toml` records the API version. Any change to the API's canonical
inputs bumps the patch version automatically (`./api-version update`). A change
that can break an existing client or script, such as a changed response shape
or different `symbol` command output, takes `./api-version bump-major`
instead: the shell client compares major versions with the server it talks to
and tells the user to run `symbol update` when they differ.

## Continuous integration

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs `sh nix/check.sh`
— the same canonical gate as `release-check` — on all four systems the flake
supports:

| System | Runner |
| --- | --- |
| `x86_64-linux` | `ubuntu-latest` |
| `aarch64-linux` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` |
| `aarch64-darwin` | `macos-latest` |

Intel macOS is not covered: nixpkgs 26.11 dropped `x86_64-darwin`, so the
flake no longer lists it as a supported system.

Because CI runs the flake rather than its own script, the two cannot drift:
adding a check to `flake.nix` adds it to CI, and a green CI run means the same
thing as a green `release-check`. Require the `all platforms` job in branch
protection; it stays green only when every matrix entry does, and its name
survives changes to the matrix.

`nix flake check` needs no secrets: every flake input is a public repository
and nixpkgs itself comes from `cache.nixos.org`. The store cache only carries
symbol's own build products, is capped well below GitHub's 10 GB per-repository
limit so the four platforms do not evict each other, and is written only by
pushes to `main`.

The server binary exposes its typed public contract for conformance tooling:

```sh
target/debug/symbol contract
```

Before release:

```sh
./release-check
```

This adds the locked release build and bounded Nix build. Production sign-off
uses the complete deployment gate:

```sh
SYMBOL_DEPLOY_CHECK=1 ./release-check
```

That installs/restarts the service and verifies STATS JSON and the public
homepage. A plain `release-check` intentionally does not mutate a running
deployment.

Long-running concurrency is a separate, opt-in release gate:

```sh
SYMBOL_SOAK_SECONDS=300 SYMBOL_SOAK_WORKERS=16 ./release-check
```

This runs concurrent PUT/GET/FILES traffic against an isolated server before
any optional production deployment check.
